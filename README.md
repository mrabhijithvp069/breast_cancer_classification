Classification Assignment – Breast Cancer Dataset

This project applies different classification algorithms to the Breast Cancer dataset using scikit-learn.  
The goal is to compare model performance and understand how different classification techniques behave on real-world medical data.

 Contents
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Implementation of 5 classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy Score
- Comparison of best and worst performing models

Summary
Random Forest and SVM performed the best with high accuracy (~97%), showing strong ability to separate malignant and benign cases.  
Decision Tree performed the worst (~92%) because it tends to overfit. Logistic Regression was a strong baseline, while k-NN gave reasonable results but was sensitive to scaling.
